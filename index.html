                        PRAMTESH MACKEZA  i do not know where to start  u r just     me but better looking

                        we started with sdmn and i think it was a bful place to start (bhai i got a hazard sst project yar virgin  loser) and i think we have discussed almost everything there is to know abt them like BHAISHAAB we are too dedicated i think

                        baaki it has always been frictionless(bigdv hassa) and somehow bond has just gotten stronger and stronger then thoda plateau then tera dv ke saath bangaya ab thoda weird limbo mein but fear not it'll return

                        u have bullied me into never using highlighter or black pen again and i am thankful for that

                    Extreme alcohol tolerance will not miss day he worked 3 months.
                    In fact, he worked harder than the ever to recuperate and bounce back from his L and is now the secretary of the very establishment he has been loyal to for the last 3 years. We will overlook the fact that he was inducted on the basis of copius amounts of fellatio.
